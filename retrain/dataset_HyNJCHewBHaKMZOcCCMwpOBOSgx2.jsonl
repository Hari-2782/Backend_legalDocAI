The agreement protects the Buyer from pre-existing liabilities that were not specifically disclosed and agreed upon. The Seller violated several of their warranties in Section 7 by not disclosing this debt. The Buyer did not assume this liability according to Section 11, which states the Buyer is only responsible for liabilities specifically mentioned in the agreement. Therefore, the Buyer has the right to be indemnified (reimbursed for all costs) by the Seller as stated in Section 11(b)."}
